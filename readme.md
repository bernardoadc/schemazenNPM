# Schemazen NPM Package

This is a npm package to simply wrap [schemazen](https://github.com/sethreno/schemazen) released executables and run inside js projects.

It may evolve to expose an API. For now, use it in shell as you would normally.

Normally it should be installed globally, but since it is arguably small (<200kb) it can be installed locally as well.
